# PaladinVR Launcher
This application is simply designed to allow users to access SteamVR from within the Cliff House without having to use the Desktop. It has been approached with a function over form approach, meaning that while it looks completely ugly, it gets the job done.

## Important Update
Microsoft have added all functionality that PaladinVR was hoping to achieve. As a result this project is no longer required. It will be archived so people can look at the code to see the history of how these projects were handled, however there will be no further development.
