# ShieldVR Launcher
This application is simply designed to allow users to access SteamVR from within the Cliff House without having to use the Desktop. It has been approached with a function over form approach, meaning that while it looks completely ugly, it gets the job done.

## Update
I have been advised that the latest insider builds of Mixed Reality Portal have the SteamVR available, provided by Microsoft. This will therefore make this project defunct. Once it has been added to release candidate, this project will be archived (people can still use it as a base for making their own projects however).
